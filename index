<h1>Remembering</h1>
<p>Rememberance Day is a whole day dedicated to the soldiers who gave their fighting for our country and for our freedheom. They are t reason we go to school without any worries or troubles and we should remember that every day, not just one. In order for us to remember, I made this page dedicated to anybody who gave their lives trying to save ours. We must remember the people who tried their hardest, fighting for justice.
